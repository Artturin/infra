# Rulebook / constitution

This is a small document that defines how this community is working.

## Project role

Provide a shared development environment and infrastructure for the Nix and
NixOS ecosystem, strictly for non-profit purposes.

## Members

There are currently two classes of members in the project:

* Community members - participants of our community.
* Administrators - members who own and administer the project.

## Community members

### Team

Anybody who contributes code to one of our project is considered a community
member.

### Responsibilities

Community members are asked to help keep a good spirit focused on building and
shipping software. Everybody is human and shall be treated with compassion and
respect.

### Power

> FIXME: this is not available yet.

Community members might create a referendum. Any referendum that has more than
10 votes gets submitted to the community at large for voting. The voting
result will be enacted on a majority vote.

## Administrators

### Team

* @Mic92
* @adisbladis
* @ryantm
* @zimbatm
* @zowoq

### Role

The role of the administrators is to support the members of the org, and the
Nix project in general.

### Responsibilities

On top of the community members responsibilities, the administrators are also
responsible for serving the community to the best of their ability and
availability.

They provide services such as:
* keep the systems updated and patched
* reply to user requests
* host new services that could help the project
* on-board new projects
* resolve conflict

### Quorum of 5 rule

To reduce the attack surface on the project, the administrative team size is
limited to 5 people.

### Power

The administrators have the power to change any aspect of the project.

Controversial changes require a majority vote. Any administrator can call a
change controversial :-)

> FIXME: we don't have a voting mechanism available yet.

The administrators might delegate some of the decision making process as a
vote to the wider community.

The administrators are the only "owners" of the github organization.

### Become an administrator

> FIXME: Our intention is to make that process more democratic in the future.

New administrators are selected by the current team.

Administrators would typically be selected from their previous activity and
participation in the project.

## Rules

### Changing the rules

> FIXME: changing the rulebook should only be possible from a community vote.

Changing this rulebook requires a quorum majority from the administrators.
